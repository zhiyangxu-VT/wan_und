# 🌌 BLIP3-o

BLIP3-o is a unified multimodal model that combines the reasoning and instruction following strength of autoregressive models with the generative power of diffusion models. Unlike prior works that diffuse VAE features or raw pixels, BLIP3-o diffuses semantically rich **CLIP image features**, enabling a powerful and efficient architecture for both image understanding and generation.

- [2025/05/19] 🔥 We understand this is a large codebase, we shared a high-level overview of its [Code Structure](https://github.com/JiuhaiChen/BLIP3o/issues/11#issuecomment-2891930000), feel free to open an issue if you encounter any problems.


- [2025/05/16] 🔥 We’ve published a dataset of 24 million images with detailed captions [BLIP3o Pretrain Long Caption](https://huggingface.co/datasets/BLIP3o/BLIP3o-Pretrain-Long-Caption) and 5 million images with short caption [BLIP3o Pretrain Short Caption](https://huggingface.co/datasets/BLIP3o/BLIP3o-Pretrain-Short-Caption). All images and their captions are compressed into tar archives, **no separate image url downloads or manual unzipping required**. 




- [2025/05/16] 🔥 We’ve reorganized and cleaned up the repository to ensure a clear, well-structured codebase. Please give the training and inference scripts a try, and feel free to leave an issue if you run into any problems. We apologize for any confusion caused by our original codebase release.

*Figure: Overview of the BLIP3-U architecture. We use Flow Matching Loss to predict the ground truth CLIP embeddings. At inference, the autoregressive model first generates a sequence of visual tokens from the given conditioning, and those visual tokens are then passed to a diffusion transformer that decodes them into the final image.* -->

## Demo



You can try out BLIP3-o in your browser using our interactive [Demo](https://blip3o.salesforceresearch.ai/). 



Install package for tranining
```Shell
conda create -n blip3o python=3.11 -y
conda activate blip3o
pip install --upgrade pip  setuptools
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Model Checkpoint

### BLIP3o-4B [4B](https://huggingface.co/BLIP3o/BLIP3o-Model-4B)

### BLIP3o-8B [8B](https://huggingface.co/BLIP3o/BLIP3o-Model-8B)

## Inference

You can  download our checkpoint:

```Shell
python -c "from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download; print(snapshot_download(repo_id='BLIP3o/BLIP3o-Model-8B', repo_type='model'))"
```

and run the inference code

```Shell
python inference.py  /HF_model/checkpoint/path/
```
## Training
We include two scripts: **slurm.sh** for multi-node training on Slurm clusters, and **run.sh** for debugging.

For both **slurm.sh** and **run.sh**, you need to import huggingface home **HF_HOME**, training data folder **IMG_FOLDER** and output model save folder **OUTPUT_FOLDER**. 

For our open source model training, we combine the pretraining dataset, including [long caption](https://huggingface.co/datasets/BLIP3o/BLIP3o-Pretrain-Long-Caption), [short caption](https://huggingface.co/datasets/BLIP3o/BLIP3o-Pretrain-Short-Caption) and [JourneyDB](https://huggingface.co/datasets/BLIP3o/BLIP3o-Pretrain-JourneyDB). 

You can download all datasets and then modify the [dataloader](https://github.com/JiuhaiChen/BLIP3o/blob/main/blip3o/train/train.py#L587) in the code to load whichever subset you need.

```
data_files = glob.glob(os.path.join('/long/caption/path', "*.tar")) + glob.glob(os.path.join('/short/caption/path', "*.tar")) + glob.glob(os.path.join('/JourneyDB/caption/path', "*.tar")) 
train_dataset = load_dataset("webdataset", data_files=data_files, split="train", num_proc=128)
```

When training the diffusion transformer from scratch, we recommend using a large number of training steps (at least **150k steps**) along with a cosine annealing learning rate schedule that decays from 1×10⁻⁴ down to 1×10⁻⁵.

When finetuning with our BLIP3o-60k, we recommend using a large number of training steps (at least **10k steps**) along with a cosine annealing learning rate schedule that decays from 1×10⁻⁴ down to 0.

## WAN 2.2 TI2V Video Training (LLM → WAN Diffusion)
This repo includes a WAN2.2-TI2V-5B training path that conditions the WAN diffusion model on the LLM’s latent tokens and trains against WAN video latents.

Required flags:
```
--video_diffusion_backend wan2.2-ti2v-5b \
--wan_model_path /path/to/Wan-AI/Wan2.2-TI2V-5B \
--data_type video \
--video_metadata_path /path/to/video_train.jsonl \
--video_folder /path/to/frames_root \
```

The JSONL format expects one sample per line:
```
{"id":"sample-1","prompt":"A robot walking in the snow.","video":"videos/sample-1","input_image":"videos/sample-1/000000.png"}
```
- `video` can be a directory of frames (sorted by filename) or use `video_frames` with an explicit list of frame paths.
- `input_image` is optional; if omitted, the first frame is used for TI2V conditioning.

Use `--num_frames`, `--video_height`, and `--video_width` to control frame sampling and resize.


## CLIP + Diffusion (Encoder + Decoder)
We also provide two CLIP + Diffusion: 

**[EVA-CLIP + SDXL]**: The model checkpoint already includes the diffusion decoder [diffusion-decoder](https://huggingface.co/BLIP3o/BLIP3o-Model/tree/main/diffusion-decoder). The EVA-CLIP vision tower weights can be downloaded here [EVA-CLIP](https://huggingface.co/jiuhai/eva_clip_vision_tower), the preprocess of EVA-CLIP is in the training code [EVA-CLIP-preprocess](https://github.com/JiuhaiChen/BLIP3o/tree/main/blip3o/model/multimodal_encoder/eva_clip).

**[SigLIP2 + SANA]**: The model checkpoint is available here [SigLIP2_SANA ](https://huggingface.co/BLIP3o/SigLIP2_SANA). 

First, download the model checkpoint:

```Shell
python -c "from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download; print(snapshot_download(repo_id='BLIP3o/SigLIP2_SANA', repo_type='model'))"
```
and update [img_path = 'fig.jpg'](https://github.com/JiuhaiChen/BLIP3o/blob/2e6775baaa6703fd8be835b658fb20c31e3ca365/siglip2_sana/inference.py#L53) to any local image you like. Run the inference code

```Shell
cd siglip2_sana
python inference.py  /HF_model/SigLIP2_SANA/path/
```

And you will get reconstruction.png.

You can download the datasets by
```Shell
python -c "from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download; print(snapshot_download(repo_id='BLIP3o/BLIP3o-Pretrain', repo_type='dataset'))"
```
And load them directly with HuggingFace WebDataset
```Shell

You can download the datasets by
```Shell
python -c "from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download; print(snapshot_download(repo_id='BLIP3o/BLIP3o-60k', repo_type='dataset'))"
```
### 💥 In general, BLIP3o-60k can help pretrained T2I models achieve a 5–7 point absolute score improvement on the GenEval and DPG benchmarks.
